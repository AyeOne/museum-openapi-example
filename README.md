### Working with the OpenAPI description

We encourage you to explore the museum's OpenAPI description and make changes.
Try experimenting with the following approaches:

**Preview the Museum OpenAPI example's API docs and observe your changes visually.**
- Run `npm run preview` to preview the documentation.
- Navigate to the **List special events** operation in the preview.
- With the preview running...
  - Go to the _openapi.yaml_ file in your IDE.
  - Search for `listSpecialEvents` to find the matching `operationId`.
  - Replace the `description` field with the snippet below:
```yaml
    description: |-
        Return a list of _upcoming_ special events at the museum.
            
        See one you like? Use this API to [buy a ticket](/#tag/Tickets/operation/buyMuseumTickets).  
```
See the updated description? This is a great way to preview how end-users of your docs will experience your changes.

**Lint your changes to the OpenAPI description using [Redocly CLI](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/).**
- Open the museum's _openapi.yaml_ file in your IDE. 
- Add the following snippet to `paths` above the /museum-hours operation:
```yaml
  /example:
    get: 
      summary: Example Summary
      description: Example description
      responses: 
        '200':
          description: Success
        '400': 
          description: Bad Request
```
- Run `npm run lint` in your terminal. See the errors? 

The linting behavior is controlled by the _redocly.yaml_ configuration file.
The linter is configured to use Redocly's [recommended ruleset](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules/recommended/#recommended-ruleset), which are built into the CLI.
However, we also added a [configurable rule](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules/configurable-rules/) for enforcing sentence casing on operation summaries.
